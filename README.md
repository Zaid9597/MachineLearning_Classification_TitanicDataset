# MachineLearning_Classification_TitanicDataset
This project aims on training the titanic dataset on all the machine learning classification Algorithms and compare the accuracy of the models.
The clasiification algorithms used in the projects are:
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machines
- Naive Bayesian Classification
- Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier
- K-Nearest Neighbours Algorithm
- Decision Tree Algorithm
- Random Forest Algorithm

Inference:
In this project, I have trained the titanic dataset on the above mentioned classification algorithms which include Logistic Regression, SVM, Naive Bayesian Classification, Stochastic Gradient Descent, K-Nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree, Random Forest. From the above accuracy results we can infer that after repeated iterations and observations, the decision tree algorithm, Random Forest, Naive Bayesian Classification and Logistic Regression always top the list and prove to be more accurate for Titanic Dataset. Also, SVM, SGD and KNN prove to be the least efficient algorithms for the dataset.
